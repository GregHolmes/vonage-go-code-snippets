These code samples are meant to be used for [https://developer.nexmo.com/](https://developer.nexmo.com/), and are structured in such a way as to be used for internal testing with the focus of one goal. For example, sending an SMS, receiving an SMS via an incoming SMS webhook or making a Text-to-speech voice call. Developers are free to use these code snippets as a reference, but these may require changes to be worked into your specific application. We recommend checking out the [Vonage API Developer Website](https://developer.nexmo.com/), which displays these code snippets in a more copy/paste fashion.
