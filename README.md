<img src="https://developer.nexmo.com/assets/images/Vonage_Nexmo.svg" height="48px" alt="Nexmo is now known as Vonage" />

These code samples are meant to be used for [https://developer.nexmo.com/](https://developer.nexmo.com/), and are structured in such a way as to be used for internal testing with the focus of one goal. For example, sending an SMS, receiving an SMS via an incoming SMS webhook or making a Text-to-speech voice call. Developers are free to use these code snippets as a reference, but these may require changes to be worked into your specific application. We recommend checking out the [Vonage API Developer Website](https://developer.nexmo.com/), which displays these code snippets in a more copy/paste fashion.

There are also quickstarts available for: [Python](https://github.com/Vonage/vonage-python-code-snippets), [.NET](https://github.com/Vonage/vonage-dotnet-code-snippets), [Node.js](https://github.com/Vonage/vonage-node-code-snippets), [PHP](https://github.com/Vonage/vonage-php-code-snippets),  [Ruby](https://github.com/Vonage/vonage-ruby-code-snippets) and [cURL](https://github.com/Vonage/vonage-curl-code-snippets).

## Set Up

To use these samples you will first need a [Vonage account](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/sign-up). Once you have your own API credentials, rename the `.env-example` file to `.env` and set the values as required for the snippet(s) you wish to run.

For the examples such as `Receiving SMS` and `Receiving Voice Calls`, you will need to:
- [buy a number](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/buy-numbers)
- [install and run Ngrok](https://www.nexmo.com/blog/2017/07/04/local-development-nexmo-ngrok-tunnel-dr)

The [Vonage API Developer](https://developer.nexmo.com/) has everything you need to build connected applications with Vonage APIs. If you have any queries on how to get progress these snippets for your own projects requirements, this dashboard is a great starting point.
